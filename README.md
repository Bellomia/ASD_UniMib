# ASD @ UniMib
Scripts for the Data Analysis exam at UniMib [2016/17]

- Script&Data contains the Python and R scripts for the various exercises.

- ASD_Esercizi_Bellomia_Binded.pdf is the final report, in pdf format. Added for convenience: therein are reported the assignments, background and methods, analysis of code and results.
NOTE: everything is typeset in italian.

- README.md is the file you are reading.

NOTE: The previously included latex-project files have been removed, as unessential and distracting. They are of course still available through commit history.
